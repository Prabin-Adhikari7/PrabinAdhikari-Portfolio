        You don't, go listen to somebody else. 
        I'm stickin' with the people who stuck with me."

    <p><blockquote>Ain't nobody talkin' when I'm talkin' fellas so shut the fuck up.
        Fall ain't 9 'em's you blist in the envelope as I call a mom.
        And empty wallet, legal paperwork, first 3 out of the 10.
        And the single file on the bench, let's go
        Open your mouths, count your tongue, bend your ears one at a time
        Okay, bend your heads over, shake 'em out with your fingers
        Hands above your head, hands up in front of you
        Over
        Move those fingers
        Reach down and lift your nutsacks
        Drop your nutsacks and skid you dick
        Turn around
        One foot at a time, pick up and wiggle your toes
        Other foot.
        Bend over grab your ass spread your cheeks and give me two big coughs.</blockquote></p>
